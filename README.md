## What is this repository for? ##

* Quick summary

This is a Java version of the lox interpreter from the book [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/introduction.html)

## How do I get set up? ##

### Running a Lox program ###

Lox has 2 modes it can run in:

1. REPL mode: Run the main method in the LoxMain class with exactly 1 program argument, the path to the Lox script you want to run.

2. Script mode: Run the main method in the LoxMain class with no program arguments.


### Generating the AST ###

The Expression class and its subtypes are generated by the GenerateAbstractSyntaxTree class. 

GenerateAbstractSyntaxTree has a main method which accepts exactly 1 program argument, the output directory of the generated Expression class.

E.g.: /Users/geertguldentops/IdeaProjects/lox/src/main/java/be/guldentops/geert/lox/grammar
