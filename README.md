## How do I get set up? ##

### Running a Lox program ###

The Lox class has a main method which accepts exactly 1 program argument, the path to the Lox script you want to run.


### Generating the AST ###

The Expression class and its subtypes are generated by the GenerateAbstractSyntaxTree class. 

GenerateAbstractSyntaxTree has a main method which accepts exactly 1 program argument, the output directory of the generated Expression class.

E.g.: /Users/geertguldentops/IdeaProjects/lox/src/main/java/be/guldentops/geert/lox/grammar

## Lox Grammar ##

    expression → literal
                | unary
                | binary
                | grouping ;

    literal    → NUMBER | STRING | "false" | "true" | "nil" ;
    grouping   → "(" expression ")" ;
    unary      → ( "-" | "!" ) expression ;
    binary     → expression operator expression ;
    operator   → "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">="
                | "+"  | "-"  | "*" | "/" ;
