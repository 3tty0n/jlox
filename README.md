## How do I get set up? ##

### Running a Lox program ###

Lox has 2 modes it can run in:

1. REPL mode: Run the main method in the Lox class with exactly 1 program argument, the path to the Lox script you want to run.

2. Script mode: Run the main method in the Lox class with no program arguments.


### Generating the AST ###

The Expression class and its subtypes are generated by the GenerateAbstractSyntaxTree class. 

GenerateAbstractSyntaxTree has a main method which accepts exactly 1 program argument, the output directory of the generated Expression class.

E.g.: /Users/geertguldentops/IdeaProjects/lox/src/main/java/be/guldentops/geert/lox/grammar

## Lox Grammar ##

    expression     → equality ;
    equality       → comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )* ;
    comparison     → addition ( ( ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ) addition )* ;
    addition       → multiplication ( ( "-" | "+" ) multiplication )* ;
    multiplication → unary ( ( "/" | "*" ) unary )* ;
    unary          → ( "!" | "-" ) unary
                   | primary ;
    primary        → NUMBER | STRING | "false" | "true" | "nil"
                   | "(" expression ")" ;
                
## Lox Precedence Rules ##

:--------------:|:---------------------:|:---------:
Unary           |   `!` `-`             | Right
Multiplication  |   `/` `*`             | Left
Addition        |   `-` `+`             | Left
Comparison      |   `>` `>=` `<` `<=`   | Left
Equality        |   `==` `!=`           | Left
